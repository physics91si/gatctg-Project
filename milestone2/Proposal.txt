For my Physics 91SI project, I would like to convert a stochastic modeling algorithm written in Apple's Swift language into Python. The stochastic simulation works by taking a list of user-specified reactions and their propensities for occuring (related to the number of metabolites and characteristic constants) and using a stochastic algorithm to determine the time between reactions and which reactions occur at any given timeStep. Possible extensions include adding a deterministic component to the model based off of Runge-Kutta approximation and using some sort of logic to determine which user reactions should be modeled by what. If time allows, I can also explore a flux-balance analysis model and try to implement a function for that.

As far as input, the user would need to specify the constants for a given reaction and the reaction itself (not exactly sure the best way to do that). This could be put in an array or matrix format for the most part.

To manipulate user data, I will use the Gillespie stochastic algorithm as described previously. The most useful functionality from scientific python will be the graphs, as they will be the output of the simulation.
